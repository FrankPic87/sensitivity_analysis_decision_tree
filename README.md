# sensitivity_analysis_decision_tree
This repository contains the Python implementation of the analytical framework presented in the paper "Comprehensive Framework for Sensitivity Analysis in Decision Tree-based Classification", submitted to IEEE I²MTC 2026.  The framework performs sensitivity analysis of Decision Tree classifiers without relying on Monte Carlo simulations.
